# NWBot

NWBot is a bot created to gather resources in New World. I am **NOT** responsible for any account bans that may occur if caught using this bot. I made this for educational purposes wrapping [GoCV (OpenCV)](https://gocv.io/) and [robotgo](https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo) inside my own module, [gamebot].

The [gamebot] module is still under heavy development alongside this bot. In the bot's current state it randomly walks around gathering resources. 
Right now most all of the bots parameters require a new build to be changed. It will be a feature to change parameters during runtime in the future. 

## Installation

You can install `nwbot` by navigating to the releases page and downloading the latest version. You will need to unzip the file and place all the files inside in a convienent location.

## Usage

Start New World and navigate to an area with plenty of resources. Click `nwbot.exe` to start running. It takes a couple seconds to start up.
